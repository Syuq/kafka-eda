## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Message Flow
1. **Producer** receives HTTP requests and publishes events to Kafka
2. **Consumer** processes events with idempotency checks
3. **Retry Logic** handles transient failures with exponential backoff
4. **DLQ** captures permanently failed messages
5. **Replay Service** allows reprocessing of DLQ messages

### Idempotency Strategy
- **Primary**: Redis-based for fast lookups
- **Secondary**: Kafka compact topics for persistence
- **Hybrid**: Combination approach for best of both worlds

### Error Handling
- **Transient Errors**: Automatic retry with backoff
- **Permanent Errors**: Send to DLQ for manual intervention
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures

### Monitoring Integration
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for request flow
- **Kafka UI**: Topic and message monitoring
- **Health Endpoints**: Service status monitoring
- **Structured Logs**: Searchable and filterable logs

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Start services (3 terminals)
./bin/consumer    # Terminal 1
./bin/producer    # Terminal 2  
./bin/replay      # Terminal 3

# 3. Test the system
./scripts/test-orders.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Build services
make build

# 3. Create topics
make topics

# 4. Run services
make consumer &
make producer &
make replay &
```
